# Hey there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Chris, an Electrical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo with a knack for both hardware and software. While my academic focus revolves around embedded systems and hardware, I've got my hands dirty in various programming languages and web development technologies.

## What I Do

- 🛠️ **Embedded Systems**: My bread and butter! I thrive on programming embedded systems using C and C++, along with many microcontroller development tools. 
- 🌐 **Full Stack Web Development**: I love crafting beautiful and functional web applications. You'll often find me tinkering with React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, MongoDB, and TailwindCSS to bring my ideas to life.

## Beyond Code

My skills aren't confined to just programming. I enjoy getting my hands on actual hardware, working through the nitty-gritty of circuits, and bringing concepts to life in the physical realm. Whether it's designing PCBs, debugging circuits, or optimizing software for efficiency, I'm up for the challenge.

## What You'll Find Here

Expect to see a mix of projects showcasing my expertise in embedded systems, web development, and perhaps some interdisciplinary explorations where hardware and software collide. Feel free to explore, contribute, or drop me a message if you have any questions or ideas to discuss.

Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding! 🚀
